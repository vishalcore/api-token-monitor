   - Go to Actions ‚Üí API Token Monitor
   - Click "Run workflow" to trigger manually

3. **Check secrets:**
   - Ensure `API_TOKEN` and `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` are properly set

4. **Check Discord permissions:**
   - Ensure the webhook has permission to post in the channel
   - Verify the webhook URL is correct and active

5. **Review workflow logs:**
   - Check the Actions tab for any error messages
   - Look for failed steps or HTTP errors
